This Car Reselling system was previously coded by me (Keiron) for InfiniteRP. We currrently do no longer use this and have decided to branch out and take a different approach so I decided I would like to share this with everyone.

Credits goes to Keiron#1111 on Discord.

Please do not try and flag this off as your own. To use this it MUST be called 'infinite-autospot', if not please do not use it. People are welcome to create pull requests, please keep in mind this hasn't been tested much and was coded raw from scratch.

If you have some type of polyzone script you can simply drag and drop this into your server and edit it from irp-polyzone:enter to your trigger. You MUST be change all exports to work for your server, and of course make sure you change any notifications to your notification system. I will offer support for this, but if I cannot help you or do not have time, I apologise. To open the core menu, you must have some type of context menu script.
